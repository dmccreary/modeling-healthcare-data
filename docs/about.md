# About the Modeling Healthcare Data With Graphs Course

Early in my career I was taught that the only way to store production data was using tables in a relational database.  Then in February of 2007 I learned the truth.  There were other ways of storing data that offered many advantages over tables.  This was the first step on a journey that changed my career.  I went on to start a conferences called the [NoSQL Now!]() conferences, I co-authored a book on NoSQL called [Making Sense of NoSQL](https://www.manning.com/books/making-sense-of-nosql), and I became a sought after consultant.

Around 2015 I was working for a fortune 10 healthcare payer.  I found that
there were very few people aware of the differences between older legacy RDBMS systems and modern graph databases.
I created a course on graph databases and was overwhelmed by the number of people that registered for these courses.

This course is the result of many years of building deploying and managing real-world graph databases to support healthcare applications.

In this course, we will focus on three perspectives of healthcare data:

1. The Patient Perspective
2. The Provider Perspective (Doctors and Hospitals)
3. The Payer Perspective (Healthcare Insurance Providers)

My sincere hope is that you will use this knowledge to lower the healthcare costs for people around the world.
