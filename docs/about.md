# About the Modeling Healthcare Data With Graphs Course

Early in my career I was taught that the only way to store production data was using tables in a relational database.  Then in February of 2007 I learned the truth.  There were other ways of storing data that offered many advantages over tables.  This was the first step on a journey that changed my career.  I went on to start a conferences called the [NoSQL Now!]() conferences, I co-authored a book on NoSQL called [Making Sense of NoSQL](https://www.manning.com/books/making-sense-of-nosql), and I became a sought after consultant.

Around 2015 I was working for a fortune 10 healthcare payer that also owned some hospitals.  I found that
there were very few people aware of the differences between older legacy RDBMS systems and modern graph databases.
I created a several courses on graph databases and was overwhelmed by the number of people that registered for these courses.
By the end of 2023 had trained over 3,000 people in how to use graphs to solve some of the most wicked problems in
healthcare.  Our healthcare graph project manged over 25 billion vertices and over 630 billion edges.  Most
queries that touched 300 million lives ran in just a few seconds.

Throughout this journey, the most difficult challenge was deploying high-quality hands-on training.  Our best instructors were often too busy doing their "day jobs" of managing our graph.  Building online training was slow and painful.
However, I believe that advanced LLM are changing all that now.  Today we can generate high-quality educational MicroSims in hours, each one can be quickly customized to the needs of our students.

This course is the result of many years of building deploying and managing real-world graph databases and training to support healthcare applications.

In this course, we will focus on three perspectives of healthcare data:

1. The **Patient** Perspective - tell me everything about my own health and the best practices to keep me healthy
2. The **Provider** Perspective (Doctors and Hospitals) - help me use data to run my clinic or hospital better and keep my patients healthy
3. The **Payer** Perspective (Healthcare Insurance Providers) - help me use data to increase my profitability and serve my members better
4. The **Population Health Scientist** - help me use data to create a better understanding our healthcare system as a whole and how we can make it more efficient

We have much work ahead of us.  Today in the US our annual per-person healthcare costs are almost double that of other countries.  And yet our lifespans are shorter.

My sincere hope is that you will use the knowledge in this course to lower the healthcare costs for all people around the world.
