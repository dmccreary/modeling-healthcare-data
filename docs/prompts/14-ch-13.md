         37 -  TODO: Generate Chapter Content
         37 +  ## Introduction
         38 +  
         39 +  Creating intelligent textbooks requires mastery of professional development tools and workflows that streamline 
            + content creation, version control, and deployment. This chapter introduces the essential development environment 
            + used throughout the intelligent textbook creation process, focusing on Visual Studio Code as the primary content 
            + authoring platform and Bash shell scripting for automation.
         40 +  
         41 +  Unlike traditional textbook authoring tools like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, intelligent textbook development
            +  leverages software engineering practices including version control with Git, command-line workflows, and 
            + automated deployment pipelines. These practices enable collaborative content development, reproducible builds, 
            + and seamless publication to web platforms like GitHub Pages.
         42 +  
         43 +  By the end of this chapter, you'll work through a comprehensive capstone project that integrates all the skills,
            +  tools, and workflows from previous chapters to create a complete intelligent textbook from concept to 
            + deployment.
         44 +  
         45 +  ## Visual Studio Code
         46 +  
         47 +  Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft that has become the de 
            + facto standard for modern software development and technical content creation. While it was initially designed 
            + for programming, its extensibility, integrated terminal, and markdown preview capabilities make it ideal for 
            + intelligent textbook authoring.
         48 +  
         49 +  ### Why VS Code for Textbook Development?
         50 +  
         51 +  Traditional word processors are optimized for print documents with fixed page layouts, while intelligent 
            + textbooks are dynamic, web-based resources built from markdown source files. VS Code provides several advantages 
            + for this workflow:
         52 +  
         53 +  - **Markdown editing with live preview:** Real-time rendering of formatted content
         54 +  - **Integrated Git support:** Version control operations without leaving the editor
         55 +  - **Built-in terminal:** Execute MkDocs commands, Python scripts, and shell utilities
         56 +  - **Extension ecosystem:** Plugins for spell-checking, markdown linting, and diagram generation
         57 +  - **Multi-file management:** Navigate complex textbook structures with hundreds of files
         58 +  - **Search and replace across files:** Consistent terminology and formatting at scale
         59 +  
         60 +  ### Key Features for Content Creators
         61 +  
         62 +  The following features are particularly valuable for intelligent textbook development:

        105 +  
        106 +  ### Installation and Setup
        107 +  
        108 +  VS Code can be downloaded from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) for macOS, Windows, and 
            + Linux. For intelligent textbook development, install these recommended extensions:
        109 +  
        110 +  | Extension | Purpose | Installation Command |
        111 +  |-----------|---------|---------------------|
        112 +  | Markdown All in One | Keyboard shortcuts, auto-preview, TOC generation | `code --install-extension 
            + yzhang.markdown-all-in-one` |
        113 +  | Code Spell Checker | Catch typos in markdown content | `code --install-extension 
            + streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker` |
        114 +  | Markdown Preview Enhanced | Advanced preview with diagrams and export | `code --install-extension 
            + shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced` |
        115 +  | Python | Syntax highlighting for Python scripts | `code --install-extension ms-python.python` |
        116 +  
        117 +  After installation, configure VS Code for optimal markdown editing by adding these settings to your user 
            + settings (Cmd/Ctrl+,):
        118 +  
        119 +  ```json
        120 +  {
        121 +    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
        122 +    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        123 +    "markdown.preview.breaks": true,
        124 +    "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true
        125 +  }
        126 +  ```
        127 +  
        128 +  ## VS Code for Content Development
        129 +  
        130 +  While VS Code is a powerful general-purpose editor, intelligent textbook content development requires specific 
            + workflows and practices that differ from traditional software development. This section covers techniques for 
            + efficiently authoring markdown content, managing chapter files, and integrating with the MkDocs build system.
        131 +  
        132 +  ### Content Authoring Workflow
        133 +  
        134 +  A typical content development session follows this pattern:
        135 +  
        136 +  1. **Open the project folder:** Use File → Open Folder to load the entire textbook repository
        137 +  2. **Start the development server:** Open integrated terminal and run `mkdocs serve`
        138 +  3. **Navigate to target chapter:** Use Explorer panel to locate the chapter's index.md file
        139 +  4. **Edit in split view:** Open markdown preview (Cmd/Ctrl+K V) to see rendered output
        140 +  5. **Save frequently:** VS Code auto-saves, but Cmd/Ctrl+S forces immediate update
        141 +  6. **Preview in browser:** Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the full site
        142 +  
        143 +  This workflow enables rapid iteration, where changes to markdown files are immediately reflected in the browser 
            + preview within 1-2 seconds of saving.
        144 +  
        145 +  ### Multi-File Editing Techniques
        146 +  
        147 +  Intelligent textbooks often require editing multiple files simultaneously—for example, updating a concept 
            + definition in the glossary while editing chapter content. VS Code provides several techniques for efficient 
            + multi-file editing:
        148 +  
        149 +  - **Split editor groups:** Drag tabs to create side-by-side or stacked editor layouts
        150 +  - **Quick Open (Cmd/Ctrl+P):** Type partial filename to instantly open any file
        151 +  - **Go to Symbol (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O):** Navigate to specific headers within long markdown files
        152 +  - **Breadcrumbs:** Show file path and document structure at top of editor
        153 +  - **Tab groups:** Organize related files (e.g., all Chapter 3 materials) in separate tab groups
        154 +  
        155 +  For complex editing tasks like renaming a concept across all chapters, use VS Code's search and replace across 
            + files feature:
        156 +  
        157 +  - Open Search panel (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F)
        158 +  - Enter search term: "Configuration Item (CI)"
        159 +  - Enter replacement: "Configuration Item"
        160 +  - Review matches in context
        161 +  - Replace All to update all instances
        162 +  
        163 +  ### Markdown Productivity Tips
        164 +  
        165 +  The following keyboard shortcuts and features accelerate markdown authoring:
        166 +  
        167 +  - **Cmd/Ctrl+B:** Toggle bold formatting on selected text
        168 +  - **Cmd/Ctrl+I:** Toggle italic formatting
        169 +  - **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V:** Open markdown preview in new tab
        170 +  - **Cmd/Ctrl+K V:** Open preview to the side
        171 +  - **Alt+Shift+F:** Auto-format current markdown file
        172 +  - **Cmd/Ctrl+/:** Toggle comment on selected lines (useful for temporary removal)
        173 +  
        174 +  The Markdown All in One extension adds additional shortcuts:
        175 +  
        176 +  - **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+]:** Insert/update table of contents
        177 +  - **Alt+C:** Check/uncheck task list items
        178 +  - **Ctrl+Shift+[:** Decrease heading level
        179 +  - **Ctrl+Shift+]:** Increase heading level
        180 +  
        181 +  ## Terminal in VS Code
        182 +  
        183 +  The integrated terminal in VS Code eliminates context switching between the editor and a separate terminal 
            + application, enabling seamless execution of build commands, Python scripts, and Git operations. This integration 
            + is particularly valuable for intelligent textbook workflows where content editing and script execution are 
            + tightly coupled.
        184 +  
        185 +  ### Accessing the Integrated Terminal
        186 +  
        187 +  The terminal can be opened in several ways:
        188 +  
        189 +  - **Keyboard shortcut:** Ctrl+` (backtick) toggles terminal visibility
        190 +  - **Menu:** View → Terminal
        191 +  - **Command Palette:** Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P, then type "Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal"
        192 +  
        193 +  By default, the terminal appears in the Panel area at the bottom of the VS Code window, but it can be moved to 
            + the side or floated as a separate panel.
        194 +  
        195 +  ### Terminal Features for Textbook Development
        196 +  
        197 +  The integrated terminal provides several advantages over standalone terminal applications:
        198 +  
        199 +  - **Automatic working directory:** Terminal opens in the project root directory
        200 +  - **Output linking:** Click file paths in error messages to jump to that file
        201 +  - **Split terminals:** Run multiple commands simultaneously (e.g., `mkdocs serve` in one, Python scripts in 
            + another)
        202 +  - **Command history:** Use up/down arrows to recall previous commands
        203 +  - **Copy/paste integration:** Cmd/Ctrl+C/V work as expected (no special terminal shortcuts needed)
        204 +  
        205 +  ### Common Terminal Commands for Textbook Projects
        206 +  
        207 +  The following commands are executed frequently during intelligent textbook development:
        208 +  
        209 +  | Command | Purpose | Typical Output |
        210 +  |---------|---------|----------------|
        211 +  | `mkdocs serve` | Start local development server | `Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000` |
        212 +  | `mkdocs build --strict` | Build site and fail on warnings | `INFO - Building documentation...` |
        213 +  | `python docs/learning-graph/analyze-graph.py` | Validate learning graph structure | `Quality score: 87/100` |
        214 +  | `./scripts/list-skills.sh` | List available Claude skills | `Available skills: glossary-generator, 
            + quiz-generator...` |
        215 +  | `git status` | Check current repository state | `On branch main, nothing to commit` |
        216 +  | `git add . && git commit -m "message"` | Stage and commit changes | `[main abc1234] message` |
        217 +  
        218 +  ### Managing Multiple Terminal Sessions
        219 +  
        220 +  Complex workflows often require multiple simultaneous terminal sessions. VS Code supports this through terminal 
            + splitting and tabs:
        221 +  
        222 +  - **Create new terminal:** Click + icon in terminal toolbar
        223 +  - **Split terminal:** Click split icon to create side-by-side terminals
        224 +  - **Rename terminal:** Right-click terminal tab, select "Rename"
        225 +  - **Kill terminal:** Click trash icon or exit the shell process
        226 +  
        227 +  A typical intelligent textbook development session might maintain three terminal sessions:
        228 +  
        229 +  1. **Development server terminal:** Running `mkdocs serve` continuously
        230 +  2. **Script execution terminal:** For running Python analysis scripts and skill invocations
        231 +  3. **Git operations terminal:** For staging commits and pushing changes
        232 +

        300 +  ## Bash
        301 +  
        302 +  Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the default command-line shell on macOS and most Linux distributions, providing a 
            + text-based interface for executing commands, running scripts, and automating workflows. While Windows uses 
            + PowerShell by default, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) provides access to Bash on Windows systems.
        303 +  
        304 +  Understanding Bash is essential for intelligent textbook development because the MkDocs build system, Python 
            + script execution, Git version control, and deployment automation all rely on command-line operations.
        305 +  
        306 +  ### Shell vs. Terminal vs. Bash
        307 +  
        308 +  These terms are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings:
        309 +  
        310 +  - **Terminal:** The application that provides a text interface (e.g., Terminal.app on macOS, Windows Terminal)
        311 +  - **Shell:** The program that interprets commands (e.g., Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell)
        312 +  - **Bash:** A specific shell implementation, currently the most widely used on Unix-like systems
        313 +  
        314 +  When you open the integrated terminal in VS Code, you're opening a terminal application that runs a shell 
            + (typically Bash or Zsh on macOS/Linux, PowerShell on Windows).
        315 +  
        316 +  ### Bash Command Structure
        317 +  
        318 +  Bash commands follow a consistent structure:
        319 +  
        320 +  ```bash
        321 +  command [options] [arguments]
        322 +  ```
        323 +  
        324 +  For example, the command `ls -la /docs/chapters` breaks down as:
        325 +  
        326 +  - **Command:** `ls` (list directory contents)
        327 +  - **Options:** `-la` (long format, show hidden files)
        328 +  - **Arguments:** `/docs/chapters` (directory to list)
        329 +  
        330 +  Options typically start with `-` (single dash) for short options or `--` (double dash) for long options. 
            + Multiple short options can be combined: `-l -a` is equivalent to `-la`.
        331 +  
        332 +  ### Essential Bash Commands for Textbook Development
        333 +  
        334 +  The following commands are used frequently in intelligent textbook workflows:
        335 +  
        336 +  | Command | Purpose | Example |
        337 +  |---------|---------|---------|
        338 +  | `pwd` | Print working directory | `pwd` → `/Users/username/textbook-project` |
        339 +  | `ls` | List directory contents | `ls -la docs/chapters` |
        340 +  | `cd` | Change directory | `cd docs/chapters/01-intro` |
        341 +  | `mkdir` | Create directory | `mkdir docs/sims/new-microsim` |
        342 +  | `touch` | Create empty file | `touch docs/chapters/05-graphs/index.md` |
        343 +  | `cp` | Copy files | `cp template.md chapter-03.md` |
        344 +  | `mv` | Move/rename files | `mv old-name.md new-name.md` |
        345 +  | `rm` | Remove files | `rm docs/chapters/draft.md` |
        346 +  | `cat` | Display file contents | `cat mkdocs.yml` |
        347 +  | `grep` | Search text | `grep "learning graph" docs/**/*.md` |
        348 +  | `chmod` | Change file permissions | `chmod +x scripts/install-skills.sh` |
        349 +  | `ln` | Create symbolic link | `ln -s ~/.claude/skills/glossary-generator ./` |
        350 +  
        351 +  ### Bash Environment and Variables
        352 +  
        353 +  Bash maintains environment variables that configure shell behavior and store system information. Common 
            + variables include:
        354 +  
        355 +  - `$HOME`: User's home directory (e.g., `/Users/username`)
        356 +  - `$PATH`: Directories searched for executable commands
        357 +  - `$PWD`: Current working directory
        358 +  - `$USER`: Current username
        359 +  
        360 +  You can display variable values using `echo`:
        361 +  
        362 +  ```bash
        363 +  echo $HOME      # /Users/username
        364 +  echo $PATH      # /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
        365 +  echo $PWD       # /Users/username/textbook-project
        366 +  ```
        367 +  
        368 +  ### Command Chaining and Redirection
        369 +  
        370 +  Bash allows combining multiple commands using operators:
        371 +  
        372 +  - **Sequential execution (`;`):** Run commands one after another regardless of success
        373 +    ```bash
        374 +    cd docs/learning-graph; python analyze-graph.py learning-graph.csv quality-metrics.md
        375 +    ```
        376 +  
        377 +  - **Conditional execution (`&&`):** Run second command only if first succeeds
        378 +    ```bash
        379 +    mkdocs build --strict && mkdocs gh-deploy
        380 +    ```
        381 +  
        382 +  - **Output redirection (`>`):** Save command output to file
        383 +    ```bash
        384 +    python analyze-graph.py learning-graph.csv > quality-report.txt
        385 +    ```
        386 +  
        387 +  - **Append to file (`>>`):** Add command output to end of existing file
        388 +    ```bash
        389 +    echo "Quality check completed" >> build-log.txt
        390 +    ```
        391 +  
        392 +  - **Pipe (`|`):** Send output of one command as input to another
        393 +    ```bash
        394 +    ls -la | grep ".md"     # List only markdown files
        395 +    ```
        396 +  
        397 +  ## Directory Navigation
        398 +  
        399 +  Efficient directory navigation is fundamental to command-line workflows, enabling quick access to chapter files,
            +  MicroSim directories, Python scripts, and configuration files. While graphical file browsers are intuitive, 
            + command-line navigation is often faster for developers who have memorized their project structure.
        400 +  
        401 +  ### Understanding File Paths
        402 +  
        403 +  File paths specify the location of files and directories in the filesystem hierarchy. There are two types of 
            + paths:
        404 +  
        405 +  - **Absolute paths:** Start from the root directory (`/` on Unix, `C:\` on Windows)
        406 +    ```bash
        407 +    /Users/username/Documents/textbook-project/docs/chapters/01-intro/index.md
        408 +    ```
        409 +  
        410 +  - **Relative paths:** Start from the current working directory
        411 +    ```bash
        412 +    # If current directory is /Users/username/Documents/textbook-project
        413 +    docs/chapters/01-intro/index.md
        414 +    ```
        415 +  
        416 +  Special directory references:
        417 +  
        418 +  - `.` (single dot): Current directory
        419 +  - `..` (double dot): Parent directory
        420 +  - `~` (tilde): User's home directory
        421 +  - `-` (dash): Previous working directory
        422 +  
        423 +  ### Navigating the Filesystem
        424 +  
        425 +  The `cd` (change directory) command moves between directories:
        426 +  
        427 +  ```bash
        428 +  # Navigate to home directory
        429 +  cd ~
        430 +  
        431 +  # Navigate to specific project directory
        432 +  cd ~/Documents/textbook-project
        433 +  
        434 +  # Navigate to subdirectory (relative path)
        435 +  cd docs/chapters
        436 +  
        437 +  # Go up one level to parent directory
        438 +  cd ..
        439 +  
        440 +  # Go up two levels
        441 +  cd ../..
        442 +  
        443 +  # Return to previous directory
        444 +  cd -
        445 +  
        446 +  # Navigate to root directory
        447 +  cd /
        448 +  ```
        449 +  
        450 +  ### Intelligent Textbook Directory Structure
        451 +  
        452 +  A typical intelligent textbook project has this structure:
        453 +  
        454 +  ```
        455 +  textbook-project/
        456 +  ├── docs/

        486 +  
        487 +  ### Navigation Best Practices
        488 +  
        489 +  Efficient navigation requires understanding project structure and using shortcuts:
        490 +  
        491 +  - **Use tab completion:** Type first few characters and press Tab to autocomplete
        492 +    ```bash
        493 +    cd docs/ch<Tab>     # Autocompletes to docs/chapters/
        494 +    ```
        495 +  
        496 +  - **Use wildcards for pattern matching:**
        497 +    ```bash
        498 +    ls docs/chapters/*/index.md     # List all chapter index files
        499 +    ```
        500 +  
        501 +  - **Create shell aliases for frequent destinations:**
        502 +    ```bash
        503 +    alias chapters="cd ~/Documents/textbook-project/docs/chapters"
        504 +    alias sims="cd ~/Documents/textbook-project/docs/sims"
        505 +    ```
        506 +  
        507 +  - **Use `pushd` and `popd` for temporary directory changes:**
        508 +    ```bash
        509 +    pushd docs/learning-graph    # Navigate and save previous location
        510 +    python analyze-graph.py learning-graph.csv quality-metrics.md
        511 +    popd                         # Return to previous location
        512 +    ```
        513 +

        619 +      - Store filesystem as nested JavaScript object
        620 +      - Track current working directory as array of path segments
        621 +      - Parse commands using string splitting and regex
        622 +      - Implement basic tab completion (suggest directory names)
        623 +      - Save progress to localStorage for session persistence

        626 +  ## File Creation and Editing
        627 +  
        628 +  Command-line file creation and editing are essential skills for automating textbook workflows, especially when 
            + generating multiple files from templates or making bulk updates. While VS Code is the primary editor for content 
            + development, knowing command-line file operations enables scripting and automation.
        629 +  
        630 +  ### Creating Files
        631 +  
        632 +  The `touch` command creates empty files or updates the modification timestamp of existing files:
        633 +  
        634 +  ```bash
        635 +  # Create a new chapter index file
        636 +  touch docs/chapters/14-future-directions/index.md
        637 +  
        638 +  # Create multiple files at once
        639 +  touch docs/chapters/14-future-directions/{index.md,exercises.md,glossary.md}
        640 +  ```
        641 +  
        642 +  The `echo` command combined with output redirection creates files with initial content:
        643 +  
        644 +  ```bash
        645 +  # Create file with single line of content
        646 +  echo "# Chapter 14: Future Directions" > docs/chapters/14-future-directions/index.md
        647 +  
        648 +  # Append content to existing file
        649 +  echo "## Summary" >> docs/chapters/14-future-directions/index.md
        650 +  ```
        651 +  
        652 +  For multi-line content, use a here-document:
        653 +  
        654 +  ```bash
        655 +  cat << EOF > docs/chapters/14-future-directions/index.md
        656 +  # Chapter 14: Future Directions
        657 +  
        658 +  ## Summary

        668 +  ```
        669 +  
        670 +  ### Editing Files
        671 +  
        672 +  While command-line text editors like `vim`, `nano`, and `emacs` are available, most intelligent textbook 
            + developers prefer editing in VS Code. However, simple text transformations can be performed using command-line 
            + tools:
        673 +  
        674 +  **`sed` (stream editor):** Perform find-and-replace operations
        675 +  
        676 +  ```bash
        677 +  # Replace all occurrences of "CMDB" with "Configuration Management Database"
        678 +  sed -i '' 's/CMDB/Configuration Management Database/g' docs/chapters/*/index.md
        679 +  
        680 +  # Add a line after a specific pattern
        681 +  sed -i '' '/## Summary/a\
        682 +  This chapter covers fundamental concepts.' docs/chapters/14-future-directions/index.md
        683 +  ```
        684 +  
        685 +  **`awk` (text processing):** Extract and transform structured text
        686 +  
        687 +  ```bash
        688 +  # Extract all level-2 headers from a file
        689 +  awk '/^## / {print $0}' docs/chapters/01-intro/index.md
        690 +  
        691 +  # Print only lines containing "learning graph"
        692 +  awk '/learning graph/ {print}' docs/chapters/*/index.md
        693 +  ```
        694 +  
        695 +  **`grep` (pattern matching):** Search for text patterns
        696 +  
        697 +  ```bash
        698 +  # Find all chapters mentioning "MicroSim"
        699 +  grep -r "MicroSim" docs/chapters/
        700 +  
        701 +  # Count occurrences of "learning graph" in all markdown files
        702 +  grep -r "learning graph" docs/ --include="*.md" | wc -l
        703 +  ```
        704 +  
        705 +  ### File Manipulation Operations
        706 +  
        707 +  Common file operations for textbook projects:
        708 +  
        709 +  | Operation | Command | Example |
        710 +  |-----------|---------|---------|
        711 +  | Copy file | `cp source destination` | `cp chapter-template.md chapter-05.md` |
        712 +  | Copy directory | `cp -r source destination` | `cp -r templates/chapter docs/chapters/05-new` |
        713 +  | Move/rename | `mv source destination` | `mv old-chapter.md new-chapter.md` |
        714 +  | Delete file | `rm filename` | `rm docs/chapters/draft.md` |
        715 +  | Delete directory | `rm -r dirname` | `rm -r docs/chapters/deprecated` |
        716 +  | Create directory | `mkdir dirname` | `mkdir docs/chapters/15-appendix` |
        717 +  | Create nested directories | `mkdir -p path/to/dir` | `mkdir -p docs/sims/new-sim/assets` |
        718 +  
        719 +  ### Safe File Operations
        720 +  
        721 +  To prevent accidental data loss, use these practices:
        722 +  
        723 +  - **Use `-i` flag for interactive confirmation:**
        724 +    ```bash
        725 +    rm -i docs/chapters/draft.md    # Prompts "remove docs/chapters/draft.md?"
        726 +    ```
        727 +  
        728 +  - **Use `-n` flag for no-clobber (don't overwrite):**
        729 +    ```bash
        730 +    cp -n source.md destination.md  # Only copies if destination doesn't exist
        731 +    ```
        732 +  
        733 +  - **Preview operations before executing:**
        734 +    ```bash
        735 +    # Preview files that would be deleted
        736 +    find docs/chapters -name "draft*.md"
        737 +    # Then delete them
        738 +    find docs/chapters -name "draft*.md" -delete
        739 +    ```
        740 +  
        741 +  - **Use version control as a safety net:**
        742 +    ```bash
        743 +    git status                      # Check for uncommitted changes
        744 +    git stash                       # Temporarily save current changes
        745 +    # Perform risky operations
        746 +    git stash pop                   # Restore changes if needed
        747 +    ```
        748 +  
        749 +  ## Shell Scripts
        750 +  
        751 +  Shell scripts are text files containing sequences of Bash commands that automate repetitive tasks. In 
            + intelligent textbook development, shell scripts are used to install Claude skills, generate content, validate 
            + quality, and deploy to production.
        752 +  
        753 +  ### Anatomy of a Shell Script
        754 +  
        755 +  A basic shell script has three components:
        756 +  
        757 +  1. **Shebang line:** Specifies the interpreter (always first line)
        758 +     ```bash
        759 +     #!/bin/bash
        760 +     ```
        761 +  
        762 +  2. **Comments:** Explain what the script does (start with `#`)
        763 +     ```bash
        764 +     # Install Claude skills to global skills directory
        765 +     ```
        766 +  
        767 +  3. **Commands:** The actual operations to perform
        768 +     ```bash
        769 +     ln -s $(pwd)/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
        770 +     ```
        771 +  
        772 +  ### Example: Installing Claude Skills
        773 +  
        774 +  The `install-claude-skills.sh` script creates symbolic links from the project's skills directory to the global 
            + Claude skills directory:
        775 +  
        776 +  ```bash
        777 +  #!/bin/bash
        778 +  
        779 +  # Install Claude skills to global skills directory
        780 +  # This makes skills available to all Claude projects
        781 +  
        782 +  SKILLS_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills"
        783 +  PROJECT_SKILLS="$(pwd)/skills"
        784 +  
        785 +  # Create skills directory if it doesn't exist
        786 +  mkdir -p "$SKILLS_DIR"
        787 +  
        788 +  # Link each skill to global directory
        789 +  for skill in "$PROJECT_SKILLS"/*; do
        790 +      skill_name=$(basename "$skill")
        791 +      echo "Installing skill: $skill_name"
        792 +      ln -sf "$skill" "$SKILLS_DIR/$skill_name"
        793 +  done
        794 +  
        795 +  echo "Skills installation complete!"
        796 +  ```
        797 +  
        798 +  ### Script Components Explained
        799 +  
        800 +  **Variables:**
        801 +  ```bash
        802 +  SKILLS_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills"      # Directory where skills are installed
        803 +  PROJECT_SKILLS="$(pwd)/skills"         # Directory containing project skills
        804 +  ```
        805 +  
        806 +  **Command substitution:**
        807 +  ```bash
        808 +  skill_name=$(basename "$skill")        # Extracts filename from full path
        809 +  ```
        810 +  
        811 +  **For loops:**
        812 +  ```bash
        813 +  for skill in "$PROJECT_SKILLS"/*; do   # Iterate over each skill directory
        814 +      # Commands here execute for each skill
        815 +  done
        816 +  ```
        817 +  
        818 +  **Conditional creation:**
        819 +  ```bash
        820 +  mkdir -p "$SKILLS_DIR"                 # Create directory if it doesn't exist
        821 +  ```
        822 +  
        823 +  **Symbolic links:**
        824 +  ```bash
        825 +  ln -sf "$skill" "$SKILLS_DIR/$skill_name"    # -s = symbolic, -f = force (replace if exists)
        826 +  ```
        827 +  
        828 +  ### Script Best Practices
        829 +  
        830 +  Effective shell scripts follow these conventions:
        831 +  
        832 +  - **Start with shebang:** `#!/bin/bash` on line 1
        833 +  - **Use meaningful variable names:** `SKILLS_DIR` not `dir1`
        834 +  - **Quote variables:** `"$variable"` prevents word splitting
        835 +  - **Check for errors:** Use `set -e` to exit on any command failure
        836 +  - **Add help text:** Provide usage instructions when run with `-h` or `--help`
        837 +  - **Use functions:** Break complex scripts into reusable functions
        838 +  - **Validate inputs:** Check that required files/directories exist
        839 +  
        840 +  ### Example: Advanced Script with Error Handling
        841 +  
        842 +  ```bash
        843 +  #!/bin/bash
        844 +  set -e  # Exit on any error
        845 +  
        846 +  # Validate learning graph quality before deployment
        847 +  
        848 +  LEARNING_GRAPH_CSV="docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.csv"
        849 +  QUALITY_THRESHOLD=70
        850 +  
        851 +  # Check that learning graph file exists
        852 +  if [ ! -f "$LEARNING_GRAPH_CSV" ]; then
        853 +      echo "Error: Learning graph file not found: $LEARNING_GRAPH_CSV"
        854 +      exit 1
        855 +  fi
        856 +  
        857 +  # Run quality analysis
        858 +  echo "Analyzing learning graph quality..."
        859 +  python docs/learning-graph/analyze-graph.py "$LEARNING_GRAPH_CSV" quality-metrics.md
        860 +  
        861 +  # Extract quality score from quality-metrics.md
        862 +  quality_score=$(grep "Quality Score:" quality-metrics.md | awk '{print $3}' | cut -d'/' -f1)
        863 +  
        864 +  echo "Quality score: $quality_score/100"
        865 +  
        866 +  # Check if quality meets threshold
        867 +  if [ "$quality_score" -lt "$QUALITY_THRESHOLD" ]; then
        868 +      echo "Error: Quality score ($quality_score) is below threshold ($QUALITY_THRESHOLD)"
        869 +      echo "Review quality-metrics.md for issues"
        870 +      exit 1
        871 +  fi
        872 +  
        873 +  echo "✓ Quality check passed! Ready for deployment."
        874 +  ```
        875 +  
        876 +  This script demonstrates:
        877 +  - Error handling with `set -e`
        878 +  - File existence checks
        879 +  - External command execution (Python script)
        880 +  - Text parsing with `grep`, `awk`, and `cut`
        881 +  - Conditional logic with `if` statements
        882 +  - Meaningful exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)
        883 +  
        884 +  ## Script Execution Permissions
        885 +  
        886 +  Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux) use a permission system to control who can read, write, or execute files. 
            + Before a shell script can be run, it must have execute permissions set.
        887 +  
        888 +  ### Understanding File Permissions
        889 +  
        890 +  File permissions are displayed by `ls -l`:
        891 +  
        892 +  ```bash
        893 +  $ ls -l scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
        894 +  -rwxr-xr-x  1 username  staff  512 Jan 15 10:30 install-claude-skills.sh
        895 +  ```
        896 +  
        897 +  The permission string `-rwxr-xr-x` breaks down as:
        898 +  
        899 +  - **File type:** `-` (regular file), `d` (directory), `l` (symbolic link)
        900 +  - **Owner permissions:** `rwx` (read, write, execute)
        901 +  - **Group permissions:** `r-x` (read, execute, no write)
        902 +  - **Other permissions:** `r-x` (read, execute, no write)
        903 +  
        904 +  ### Permission Notation
        905 +  
        906 +  Permissions can be represented in two formats:
        907 +  
        908 +  **Symbolic notation:**
        909 +  ```
        910 +  r = read (4)
        911 +  w = write (2)
        912 +  x = execute (1)
        913 +  ```
        914 +  
        915 +  **Numeric notation (octal):**
        916 +  ```
        917 +  rwx = 4+2+1 = 7
        918 +  r-x = 4+0+1 = 5
        919 +  r-- = 4+0+0 = 4
        920 +  ```
        921 +  
        922 +  Common permission combinations:
        923 +  
        924 +  | Octal | Symbolic | Meaning |
        925 +  |-------|----------|---------|
        926 +  | 755 | -rwxr-xr-x | Owner can read/write/execute, others can read/execute |
        927 +  | 644 | -rw-r--r-- | Owner can read/write, others can read only |
        928 +  | 700 | -rwx------ | Owner can read/write/execute, others have no access |
        929 +  | 775 | -rwxrwxr-x | Owner and group can read/write/execute, others can read/execute |
        930 +  
        931 +  ### Making Scripts Executable
        932 +  
        933 +  To make a script executable, use the `chmod` command:
        934 +  
        935 +  ```bash
        936 +  # Add execute permission for owner
        937 +  chmod +x scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
        938 +  
        939 +  # Add execute permission for everyone
        940 +  chmod a+x scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
        941 +  
        942 +  # Set specific permissions using numeric notation
        943 +  chmod 755 scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
        944 +  ```
        945 +  
        946 +  After setting execute permissions, the script can be run directly:
        947 +  
        948 +  ```bash
        949 +  # Run with full path
        950 +  ./scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
        951 +  
        952 +  # Run with relative path
        953 +  cd scripts
        954 +  ./install-claude-skills.sh
        955 +  
        956 +  # Run from anywhere if in PATH
        957 +  install-claude-skills.sh
        958 +  ```

        966 +      Layout: Grid layout with three main sections
        967 +  
        968 +      Section 1 - Permission String Breakdown (top):
        969 +      - Large text: `-rwxr-xr-x`
        970 +      - Each character highlighted separately:
        971 +        - `-` → "File type: Regular file"
        972 +        - `rwx` → "Owner: Read, Write, Execute"
        973 +        - `r-x` → "Group: Read, Execute only"
        974 +        - `r-x` → "Others: Read, Execute only"
        975 +      - Color coding: Owner (blue), Group (green), Others (orange)
        976 +  
        977 +      Section 2 - Octal Representation (middle):
        978 +      - Visual breakdown showing how rwx maps to numbers:
        979 +        ```
        980 +        r w x
        981 +        4 2 1
        982 +        ```
        983 +      - Example calculations:
        984 +        - rwx = 4+2+1 = 7
        985 +        - r-x = 4+0+1 = 5
        986 +        - r-- = 4+0+0 = 4
        987 +      - Final octal: **755**
        988 +  
        989 +      Section 3 - Common Permissions (bottom):
        990 +      - Cards showing common permission sets:
        991 +  
        992 +        Card 1: "Executable Script"
        993 +        - Octal: 755
        994 +        - Symbolic: -rwxr-xr-x

       1033 +  
       1034 +  ### Security Considerations
       1035 +  
       1036 +  Execute permissions should be granted carefully:
       1037 +  
       1038 +  - **Only make scripts executable if they need to be run:** Don't blindly `chmod +x` all files
       1039 +  - **Review scripts before making them executable:** Malicious scripts can damage systems
       1040 +  - **Be cautious with scripts from untrusted sources:** Always inspect before running
       1041 +  - **Use least privilege:** Grant minimum permissions necessary (e.g., 700 for personal scripts instead of 777)
       1042 +  
       1043 +  ### Troubleshooting Permission Issues
       1044 +  
       1045 +  Common permission-related errors:
       1046 +  
       1047 +  **Error: "Permission denied"**
       1048 +  ```bash
       1049 +  $ ./scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
       1050 +  -bash: ./scripts/install-claude-skills.sh: Permission denied
       1051 +  ```
       1052 +  **Solution:** Add execute permission
       1053 +  ```bash
       1054 +  chmod +x scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
       1055 +  ```
       1056 +  
       1057 +  **Error: "No such file or directory" when script exists**
       1058 +  ```bash
       1059 +  $ ./scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
       1060 +  -bash: ./scripts/install-claude-skills.sh: No such file or directory
       1061 +  ```
       1062 +  **Cause:** Incorrect shebang line (e.g., Windows line endings)
       1063 +  **Solution:** Convert line endings to Unix format
       1064 +  ```bash
       1065 +  dos2unix scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
       1066 +  ```
       1067 +  
       1068 +  ## Symlink Creation
       1069 +  
       1070 +  Symbolic links (symlinks) are special files that act as pointers to other files or directories, enabling 
            + multiple paths to access the same content. In intelligent textbook development, symlinks are used to install 
            + Claude skills globally while maintaining the skills in the project repository.
       1071 +  
       1072 +  ### Why Use Symlinks for Skills?
       1073 +  
       1074 +  Claude Code looks for skills in `~/.claude/skills/` by default. Without symlinks, you would need to:
       1075 +  
       1076 +  - Copy skill files to `~/.claude/skills/` every time they're updated
       1077 +  - Maintain duplicate copies in each project
       1078 +  - Manually synchronize changes across projects
       1079 +  
       1080 +  Symlinks solve this by creating a reference in `~/.claude/skills/` that points to the original skill files in 
            + the project repository. When the original files are updated, the changes are immediately reflected in all 
            + projects using that symlink.
       1081 +  
       1082 +  ### Creating Symlinks
       1083 +  
       1084 +  The `ln` command creates symbolic links:
       1085 +  
       1086 +  ```bash
       1087 +  # Syntax
       1088 +  ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link
       1089 +  
       1090 +  # Example: Link a single skill
       1091 +  ln -s ~/Documents/textbook-project/skills/glossary-generator ~/.claude/skills/glossary-generator
       1092 +  
       1093 +  # Example: Link all skills in a directory
       1094 +  ln -s ~/Documents/textbook-project/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
       1095 +  ```
       1096 +  
       1097 +  **Flags:**
       1098 +  - `-s`: Create symbolic link (not a hard link)
       1099 +  - `-f`: Force overwrite if link already exists
       1100 +  - `-n`: Don't dereference existing symlink (useful when updating)
       1101 +  
       1102 +  ### Symlinks vs. Copies
       1103 +  
       1104 +  Understanding the difference is crucial:
       1105 +  
       1106 +  | Operation | Copy | Symlink |
       1107 +  |-----------|------|---------|
       1108 +  | Storage | Duplicates content | Only stores pointer (~1KB) |
       1109 +  | Updates | Manual re-copy needed | Automatic (follows original) |
       1110 +  | Deletion | Independent files | Deleting symlink doesn't affect original |
       1111 +  | Portability | Works if original is deleted | Breaks if original is moved/deleted |
       1112 +  | Permissions | Uses copy's permissions | Uses original's permissions |
       1113 +  
       1114 +  ### Verifying Symlinks
       1115 +  
       1116 +  Use `ls -l` to see symlink targets:
       1117 +  
       1118 +  ```bash
       1119 +  $ ls -l ~/.claude/skills/glossary-generator
       1120 +  lrwxr-xr-x  1 username  staff  72 Jan 15 10:30 glossary-generator -> 
            + /Users/username/Documents/textbook-project/skills/glossary-generator
       1121 +  ```
       1122 +  
       1123 +  The `->` arrow indicates this is a symlink pointing to the target path.
       1124 +  
       1125 +  ### Managing Symlinks
       1126 +  
       1127 +  **List all symlinks in a directory:**
       1128 +  ```bash
       1129 +  find ~/.claude/skills/ -type l -ls
       1130 +  ```
       1131 +  
       1132 +  **Check if a symlink target exists:**
       1133 +  ```bash
       1134 +  test -e ~/.claude/skills/glossary-generator && echo "Target exists" || echo "Broken symlink"
       1135 +  ```
       1136 +  
       1137 +  **Remove a symlink:**
       1138 +  ```bash
       1139 +  rm ~/.claude/skills/glossary-generator     # Removes link only, original unaffected
       1140 +  ```
       1141 +  
       1142 +  **Update a symlink to point to a new target:**
       1143 +  ```bash
       1144 +  ln -sf /new/path/to/skill ~/.claude/skills/glossary-generator
       1145 +  ```
       1146 +  
       1147 +  ### Project-Local vs. Global Skills
       1148 +  
       1149 +  Claude Code supports two skill installation strategies:
       1150 +  
       1151 +  **Global skills (`~/.claude/skills/`):**
       1152 +  - Available to all projects
       1153 +  - Ideal for stable, mature skills used across multiple textbooks
       1154 +  - Installed via `scripts/install-claude-skills.sh`
       1155 +  
       1156 +  **Project-local skills (`.claude/skills/`):**
       1157 +  - Available only to the current project
       1158 +  - Ideal for experimental or project-specific skills
       1159 +  - Installed by creating `.claude/skills/` directory in project root
       1160 +  
       1161 +  The installation script can be modified to install to project-local directory by changing:
       1162 +  
       1163 +  ```bash
       1164 +  # From:
       1165 +  SKILLS_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills"
       1166 +  
       1167 +  # To:
       1168 +  SKILLS_DIR="$(pwd)/.claude/skills"
       1169 +  ```
       1170 +  
       1171 +  ### Troubleshooting Symlinks
       1172 +  
       1173 +  **Problem: "Skill not found" error in Claude Code**
       1174 +  
       1175 +  Possible causes:
       1176 +  1. Symlink not created correctly
       1177 +  2. Target path is incorrect
       1178 +  3. Permissions issue on target directory
       1179 +  
       1180 +  **Solution:**
       1181 +  ```bash
       1182 +  # Verify symlink exists
       1183 +  ls -l ~/.claude/skills/
       1184 +  
       1185 +  # Check target is accessible
       1186 +  ls -l ~/Documents/textbook-project/skills/glossary-generator
       1187 +  
       1188 +  # Re-create symlink with correct path
       1189 +  ln -sf ~/Documents/textbook-project/skills/glossary-generator ~/.claude/skills/glossary-generator
       1190 +  ```
       1191 +  
       1192 +  **Problem: "Permission denied" when running skill**
       1193 +  
       1194 +  **Solution:**
       1195 +  ```bash
       1196 +  # Ensure original skill directory has correct permissions
       1197 +  chmod -R 755 ~/Documents/textbook-project/skills/
       1198 +  ```

       1258 +  The capstone project synthesizes all skills, tools, and workflows from this course by guiding you through the 
            + complete process of creating an intelligent textbook from initial concept to published website. This 
            + comprehensive project mirrors real-world educational content development and demonstrates your ability to apply 
            + course concepts independently.
       1259 +  
       1260 +  ### Project Overview
       1261 +  
       1262 +  You will create an intelligent textbook on a subject of your choice, following the complete workflow:
       1263 +  
       1264 +  1. Develop a comprehensive course description
       1265 +  2. Generate a 200-concept learning graph with dependencies
       1266 +  3. Design chapter structure based on concept dependencies
       1267 +  4. Create chapter content with interactive elements
       1268 +  5. Generate glossary, quiz, and FAQ content
       1269 +  6. Build and deploy the textbook to GitHub Pages
       1270 +  
       1271 +  The project typically requires 15-25 hours depending on textbook scope and prior experience. You are encouraged 
            + to choose a subject in which you have expertise, as domain knowledge significantly accelerates content creation.
       1272 +  
       1273 +  ### Project Requirements

       1298 +  - README with project overview and build instructions
       1299 +  
       1300 +  ### Phase 1: Course Design (3-5 hours)
       1301 +  
       1302 +  **Step 1: Course Description Development**
       1303 +  
       1304 +  Use the `course-description-analyzer` skill to create your course description:
       1305 +  
       1306 +  ```bash
       1307 +  # In Claude Code, invoke the skill
       1308 +  /skill course-description-analyzer
       1309 +  ```
       1310 +  
       1311 +  Your course description should specify:
       1312 +  - Course title and target audience (reading level)
       1313 +  - Prerequisites and assumed knowledge
       1314 +  - Main topics covered (15-25 topics)
       1315 +  - Topics explicitly out of scope (5-10 topics)
       1316 +  - Learning outcomes across all six Bloom's Taxonomy levels
       1317 +  
       1318 +  **Quality check:**
       1319 +  ```bash
       1320 +  # Skill will generate quality score
       1321 +  # Target: ≥ 85/100
       1322 +  ```
       1323 +  
       1324 +  **Step 2: Learning Graph Generation**
       1325 +  
       1326 +  Use the `learning-graph-generator` skill to create your concept map:
       1327 +  
       1328 +  ```bash
       1329 +  /skill learning-graph-generator
       1330 +  ```
       1331 +  
       1332 +  The skill will:
       1333 +  - Enumerate 200 concepts from your course description
       1334 +  - Map concept dependencies (directed acyclic graph)
       1335 +  - Categorize concepts by taxonomy
       1336 +  - Validate graph quality
       1337 +  
       1338 +  **Quality check:**
       1339 +  ```bash
       1340 +  cd docs/learning-graph
       1341 +  python analyze-graph.py learning-graph.csv quality-metrics.md
       1342 +  
       1343 +  # Target: Quality score ≥ 70/100
       1344 +  # Ensure zero circular dependencies
       1345 +  ```
       1346 +  
       1347 +  **Step 3: Chapter Structure Design**
       1348 +  
       1349 +  Use the `book-chapter-generator` skill to design chapters:
       1350 +  
       1351 +  ```bash
       1352 +  /skill book-chapter-generator
       1353 +  ```
       1354 +  
       1355 +  The skill creates chapter directories with:
       1356 +  - Chapter title and summary
       1357 +  - List of concepts covered in each chapter
       1358 +  - Prerequisites linking to earlier chapters
       1359 +  
       1360 +  **Review:**
       1361 +  - Verify concept dependencies are respected (prerequisites taught before dependents)
       1362 +  - Ensure even distribution (no chapter has >40 concepts)
       1363 +  - Check that foundational concepts appear in early chapters
       1364 +  
       1365 +  ### Phase 2: Content Creation (8-15 hours)
       1366 +  
       1367 +  **Step 4: Generate Chapter Content**
       1368 +  
       1369 +  For each chapter, use the `chapter-content-generator` skill:
       1370 +  
       1371 +  ```bash
       1372 +  /skill chapter-content-generator
       1373 +  # Provide chapter name or path when prompted
       1374 +  ```
       1375 +  
       1376 +  The skill generates:
       1377 +  - Detailed educational content at appropriate reading level
       1378 +  - Diverse non-text elements (lists, tables, diagrams)
       1379 +  - Specifications for complex elements (MicroSims, infographics) in `<details>` blocks
       1380 +  
       1381 +  **Minimum requirement:** Complete 3 chapters with rich content
       1382 +  
       1383 +  **Step 5: Create Interactive Elements**
       1384 +  
       1385 +  Implement at least one MicroSim using the `microsim-p5` skill:
       1386 +  
       1387 +  ```bash
       1388 +  /skill microsim-p5
       1389 +  ```
       1390 +  
       1391 +  Choose a concept that benefits from interactive visualization, such as:
       1392 +  - Algorithm visualization (sorting, graph traversal)
       1393 +  - System behavior simulation (networking, resource allocation)
       1394 +  - Parameter exploration (statistical distributions, optimization)
       1395 +  
       1396 +  **Step 6: Build Supporting Resources**
       1397 +  
       1398 +  Generate glossary:
       1399 +  ```bash
       1400 +  /skill glossary-generator
       1401 +  ```
       1402 +  
       1403 +  Generate chapter quizzes:
       1404 +  ```bash
       1405 +  /skill quiz-generator
       1406 +  # Generate quiz for at least one chapter
       1407 +  ```
       1408 +  
       1409 +  Generate FAQ:
       1410 +  ```bash
       1411 +  /skill faq-generator
       1412 +  ```
       1413 +  
       1414 +  ### Phase 3: Integration and Quality Assurance (2-4 hours)
       1415 +  
       1416 +  **Step 7: Configure MkDocs**
       1417 +  
       1418 +  Update `mkdocs.yml` navigation to include all content:
       1419 +  
       1420 +  ```yaml
       1421 +  nav:
       1422 +    - Home: index.md
       1423 +    - Learning Graph:
