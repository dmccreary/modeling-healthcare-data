# Concept Taxonomy for Modeling Healthcare Data with Graphs

This document defines the categorical taxonomy for organizing the 200 concepts in the learning graph. Each category has a TaxonomyID (3-5 letter abbreviation) and a description of the concepts it contains.

## Taxonomy Categories

### 1. Foundation Concepts
**TaxonomyID**: FOUND

**Description**: Fundamental concepts in graph theory and database systems that serve as prerequisites for understanding healthcare graph modeling. Includes basic graph structures, database concepts, and data modeling principles.

---

### 2. Graph Technologies
**TaxonomyID**: GTECH

**Description**: Technical concepts related to graph databases, query languages, and graph database implementation. Includes Cypher, GQL, GSQL, indexing, query optimization, and performance tuning.

---

### 3. Healthcare Domain
**TaxonomyID**: HCARE

**Description**: Core healthcare system concepts, terminology, and organizational structures. Includes healthcare economics, care models, medical coding systems, and healthcare interoperability.

---

### 4. Patient Data
**TaxonomyID**: PAT

**Description**: Patient-centric concepts covering clinical data, diagnoses, treatments, medications, and patient care management. Includes patient records, care plans, outcomes, and patient journey mapping.

---

### 5. Provider Operations
**TaxonomyID**: PROV

**Description**: Healthcare provider concepts including hospitals, clinics, physicians, scheduling, referrals, and provider networks. Covers credentials, performance metrics, and care team coordination.

---

### 6. Payer & Insurance
**TaxonomyID**: PAYER

**Description**: Insurance and payer-related concepts including claims processing, policies, coverage, benefits, and reimbursement. Includes pharmacy benefit management and utilization review.

---

### 7. Financial & Business
**TaxonomyID**: FIN

**Description**: Healthcare business and financial concepts covering revenue cycles, cost analysis, profitability, contracts, and value-based payment models. Includes billing codes and charge masters.

---

### 8. Fraud & Compliance
**TaxonomyID**: FRAUD

**Description**: Concepts related to detecting and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse in healthcare. Includes fraud detection techniques, anomaly detection, and specific fraud patterns.

---

### 9. Graph Analytics
**TaxonomyID**: ANAL

**Description**: Graph algorithms and analytical techniques including pathfinding, centrality measures, community detection, clustering, and graph pattern recognition. Includes graph embeddings and neural networks.

---

### 10. AI & Machine Learning
**TaxonomyID**: AI

**Description**: Artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts applied to healthcare. Includes LLMs, vector stores, semantic search, clinical decision support, predictive analytics, and recommendation systems.

---

### 11. Security & Privacy
**TaxonomyID**: SEC

**Description**: Healthcare data security and privacy concepts including HIPAA compliance, access control, authentication, authorization, and de-identification of protected health information.

---

### 12. Data Governance
**TaxonomyID**: GOV

**Description**: Data management, governance, and quality concepts including metadata management, data lineage, provenance, traceability, and explainability. Includes master data management and data stewardship.

---

### 13. Capstone & Career
**TaxonomyID**: CAP

**Description**: Final capstone projects, presentations, career development, and real-world implementation concepts. Represents the culmination of learning and application to practical scenarios.

---

## Distribution Guidelines

Each category should ideally contain:

- **Minimum**: 5-10 concepts
- **Target**: 10-20 concepts
- **Maximum**: 30 concepts (avoid exceeding 15% of total)

The MISC category should be used sparingly for concepts that don't fit clearly into other categories.
