   - Chapter 2: 7 healthcare system concepts
   - Chapter 6: Benefits Plan, Copay, Deductible

### Medium Priority

1. **Scenario Questions:** Add 2-3 multi-part case studies per chapter for deeper assessment
2. **Alternative Questions:** Create 2-3 alternative versions per concept for question rotation
3. **Difficulty Calibration:** After first student cohort, analyze item statistics

### Low Priority

1. **Cross-Chapter Integration:** Add 5-10 questions testing synthesis across chapters
2. **LMS Export:** Create Moodle XML, Canvas JSON, and QTI formats
3. **Accessibility:** Verify screen reader compatibility of quiz format

## Implementation Quality

### Files Created

**Quiz Files:**
- 12 quiz.md files in chapter directories
- Format: `/docs/chapters/[chapter-name]/quiz.md`

**Metadata Files:**

   - Analyze item difficulty and discrimination statistics
   - Refine questions based on student performance
   - Add questions for untested concepts

4. **Long-Term (Ongoing):**
   - Expand to 15-20 questions per chapter
   - Create adaptive quiz paths based on performance
   - Integrate with chatbot for practice mode
