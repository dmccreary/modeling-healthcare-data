# Graph Query Languages and Technologies

## Summary

This chapter explores the technical aspects of querying graph databases using industry-standard languages including Cypher, GQL, and GSQL. You will learn graph pattern matching techniques, query optimization strategies, indexing methods, and performance tuning approaches. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to write efficient queries to extract insights from complex healthcare graph data.
