# AI and Machine Learning Integration

## Summary

This chapter integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning with graph databases for advanced healthcare applications. You will learn about large language models (LLMs), vector stores, vector embeddings, semantic search, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, knowledge graphs, and the complementary nature of graphs and LLMs. Applications include clinical decision support, clinical discovery, recommendation systems, predictive analytics, risk stratification, and population health analytics.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Artificial Intelligence
2. Machine Learning
3. Large Language Model
4. Vector Store
5. Vector Embedding
6. Semantic Search
7. RAG Architecture
8. Knowledge Graph
9. Graph And LLM Integration
10. Clinical Decision Support
11. Clinical Discovery
12. Recommendation System
13. Predictive Analytics
14. Risk Stratification
15. Population Health Analytics

## Prerequisites
