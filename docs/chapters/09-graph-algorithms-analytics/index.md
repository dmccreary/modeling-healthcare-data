# Graph Algorithms and Analytics

## Summary

This chapter teaches fundamental and advanced graph algorithms for healthcare analytics. You will learn shortest path algorithms, centrality measures (PageRank, betweenness, degree), clustering coefficients, connected components, cycle detection, graph pattern recognition, similarity measures, link prediction, graph embeddings, node embeddings, and graph neural networks. These algorithms provide powerful tools for discovering insights, predicting outcomes, and understanding complex relationships in healthcare data.
