# Patient-Centric Data Modeling

## Summary

This chapter focuses on modeling healthcare data from the patient perspective, placing the patient record at the center of the graph model. You will learn to model patient demographics, medical history, diseases, conditions, symptoms, diagnoses, treatment plans, prescriptions, medications, lab tests, vital signs, allergies, immunizations, care plans, and patient journeys. This comprehensive approach to patient data modeling enables better care coordination, chronic disease management, and improved patient outcomes.
