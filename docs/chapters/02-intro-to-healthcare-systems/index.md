# Introduction to Healthcare Systems

## Summary

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the healthcare system landscape, covering cost models (fee-for-service vs value-based care), key stakeholders (patients, providers, payers), and critical medical coding systems (ICD, CPT, HCPCS, Drug Codes). You will understand the complexities of electronic health records, medical terminology, clinical workflows, and healthcare interoperability. This domain knowledge is essential for designing effective graph models that accurately represent healthcare data.
