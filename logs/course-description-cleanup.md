# Course Description Cleanup Session Log

**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Project:** Modeling Healthcare Data with Graphs
**Task:** Review and improve course-description.md for clarity, grammar, and professional presentation

## Session Overview

Reviewed the course description document and made minor wording changes, grammar fixes, and formatting improvements to enhance clarity and professionalism for an undergraduate college-level course.

## Changes Made

### 1. Course Overview Section - Major Improvements

#### Terminology Corrections
- **"US" → "United States"** - Used full formal name for academic writing
- **"pay-per-services" → "fee-for-service"** - Corrected to standard healthcare industry terminology
- **"a value-based care systems" → "value-based care models"** - Fixed grammar and terminology
- **"database excel" → "databases excel"** - Fixed subject-verb agreement (plural)
- **"prescription" → "prescriptions"** - Made plural for consistency with other items in list
- **"diagnosis" → "diagnoses"** - Corrected to plural form
- **"linage" → "lineage"** - Corrected spelling (data lineage is the proper term)
- **"expandability" → "explainability"** - Corrected term in context (AI/ML explainability is the appropriate concept)

#### Clarity Improvements
- **"tabular data" → "tabular relational structures"** - More precise technical description
- **"include modeling" → "encompasses modeling"** - Better word variety and flow
- **"graph databases are use" → "graph databases support"** - Improved grammar and clarity
- **"used in conjunction with" → clearer phrasing** - Maintained throughout
- **"LLMs" → "large language models (LLMs)"** - Added full term on first use
- **"KPIs" → "key performance indicators (KPIs)"** - Added full term on first use
- **"RBAC" → "role-based access control (RBAC)"** - Added full term on first use

#### Content Organization
- **Removed duplicate sentence** - "The annual per-person cost for healthcare in the US is the most expensive in the world by a large margin" appeared twice; removed the redundant instance
- **Improved paragraph flow** - Better transitions between patient, provider, and payer perspectives
- **Enhanced technical precision** - Made descriptions more accurate for undergraduate academic level

### 2. Main Topics Covered Section

**Spelling Corrections:**
- **"Linage" → "Lineage"** - Fixed typo in data governance concepts list

### 3. Learning Outcomes Section

#### Formatting Fixes
- **Removed extra blank lines** - Standardized spacing between sections (Remember, Understand, Analyze, Evaluate)
- **Fixed double dashes** - "patient--provider--payer" → "patient-provider-payer" (standard hyphenation)
- **Removed leading space** - Fixed indentation on "Design and implement" bullet point in Create section
- **Consolidated bullet points** - Improved formatting consistency in Create section

#### Content Consistency
- Ensured all Bloom's Taxonomy levels use consistent formatting
- Maintained parallel structure in learning outcome statements

### 4. Use of AI Section

**Spacing:**
- **Fixed double space** - "encouraged.  We" → "encouraged. We" (single space after period)

## Document Structure Analysis
