Then in February of 2007 I learned the truth.  There were other ways of storing data that offered many advantages over tables.  This was the first step on a journey that changed my career.  I went on to start a conferences called the NoSQL Now! conferences, I co-authored a book on NoSQL called Making Sense of NoSQL, and I became a sought after consultant.</p> <p>Around 2015 I was working for a fortune 10 healthcare payer.  I found that there were very few people aware of the differences between older legacy RDBMS systems and modern graph databases. I created a course on graph databases and was overwhelmed by the number of people that registered for these courses.</p> <p>This course is the result of many years of building deploying and managing real-world graph databases to support healthcare applications.</p> <p>In this course, we will focus on three perspectives of healthcare data:</p> <ol> <li>The Patient Perspective</li> <li>The Provider Perspective (Doctors and Hospitals)</li> <li>The Payer Perspective (Healthcare Insurance Providers)</li> </ol> <p>My sincere hope is that you will use this knowledge to lower the healthcare costs for people around the world.</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Please contact me on LinkedIn</p> <p>Thanks! - Dan</p>"},{"location":"course-description/","title":"Course Description for Modeling Healthcare Data with Graphs","text":"<p>Title: Modeling Healthcare Data with Graphs</p> <p>Target Audience: College Undergraduate</p> <p>Prerequisites: Knowledge of databases</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#course-overview","title":"Course Overview","text":"<p>The annual per-person cost for healthcare in the US is the most expensive in the world by a large margin.  Modern graph databases offer ways to lower these costs by providing superior analytics to enable moving from expensive pay-per-services systems to a value-based care systems.</p> <p>This course teaches students to model complex healthcare data from multiple perspectives including the patient, provider and payer. We begin with a review of the many challenges of modeling complex interconnected clinical data.  We discuss why tabular data is not a good fit for clinical data and how graph database excel at this task.  We introduce the concepts of graph algorithms, graph data science, embeddings and graph-neural networks.</p> <p>We begin with a patient-centric graph data model that puts the patient record at the center of our graph including modeling patient attributes such as demographics, diseases, conditions, prescriptions, diagnosis, treatments, symptoms, procedures, providers and care plans.  We then branch out to include the provider perspective which include modeling individual providers, hospitals, clinics, schedules, claims, costs, revenue and profitability.  Next we take a look at the payer perspective which includes claims, fraud, waste, abuse, provider networks, policies, coverage, disputes, population analytics and profitability.</p> <p>The core of our course looks at how graph databases are use to support analytics, clinical rules, recommendation systems and data quality within healthcare.  We take a close look at the use of vector stores used in conjunction with AI and LLMs.</p> <p>Next we focus on the types of analytics used by each of our perspectives and discuss both operational reporting, KPIs and real-time clinical discovery applications that benefit from the use of graph databases.  Finally we conclude with advanced topics such as security, HIPAA, RBAC, data governance, linage, traceability, expandability and the use of machine learning and LLMs to create precise care path recommendations that combine quality with expandability.</p> <p>The annual per-person cost for healthcare in the US is the most expensive in the world by a large margin.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#main-topics-covered","title":"Main Topics Covered","text":"<ul> <li>Annual Costs</li> <li>Per Person Costs</li> <li>Fee for Services</li> <li>Value-based Care</li> <li>Graph Data Models</li> <li>Legacy Healthcare</li> <li>Labeled Property Graphs</li> <li>Nodes</li> <li>Node Properties</li> <li>Edges</li> <li>Edge Properties</li> <li>Graph Queries</li> <li>Graph Performance</li> <li>Personas</li> <li>Patient Viewpoint</li> <li>Provider Viewpoint</li> <li>Payer Viewpoint</li> <li>Hospitals</li> <li>Clinics</li> <li>Primary Care Provider</li> <li>Demographics</li> <li>Encounter</li> <li>Diseases</li> <li>Conditions</li> <li>Prescriptions</li> <li>Diagnosis</li> <li>Treatments</li> <li>Symptoms</li> <li>Procedures</li> <li>ICD Codes</li> <li>CPT Codes</li> <li>HCPCS Codes</li> <li>Drug Codes</li> <li>Providers</li> <li>Primary Care Provider</li> <li>Hospital</li> <li>Clinic</li> <li>Schedules</li> <li>Claims</li> <li>Costs</li> <li>Revenue</li> <li>Profitability</li> <li>Fraud</li> <li>Waste</li> <li>Abuse</li> <li>Provider Networks</li> <li>Policies</li> <li>Coverage</li> <li>Benefit Plans</li> <li>Copay</li> <li>Deductible</li> <li>Disputes</li> <li>Pharmacy Benefit Manager</li> <li>Formulary Rules</li> <li>Brand Drugs</li> <li>Generic Drugs</li> <li>Rules in Graphs</li> <li>Rules Engines</li> <li>Clinical Decisions</li> <li>Clinical Decision Support</li> <li>Clinical Discovery</li> <li>Operational Reporting</li> <li>Key Performance Indicators</li> <li></li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#topics-not-covered","title":"Topics Not Covered","text":"<ul> <li>Resource Description Format</li> <li>Semantic Web</li> <li>Mainframes</li> <li>COBOL</li> <li>SAS</li> <li>Statistics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#learning-outcomes","title":"Learning Outcomes","text":"<p>After completing this course, students will be able to:</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#remember","title":"Remember","text":"<p>Retrieving, recognizing, and recalling relevant knowledge from long-term memory.</p> <ul> <li>[Outcome 1]</li> <li>[Outcome 2]</li> <li>[Add more as needed]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#understand","title":"Understand","text":"<p>Constructing meaning from instructional messages, including oral, written, and graphic communication.</p> <ul> <li>[Outcome 1]</li> <li>[Outcome 2]</li> <li>[Add more as needed]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#apply","title":"Apply","text":"<p>Carrying out or using a procedure in a given situation.</p> <ul> <li>[Outcome 1]</li> <li>[Outcome 2]</li> <li>[Add more as needed]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#analyze","title":"Analyze","text":"<p>Breaking material into constituent parts and determining how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose.</p> <ul> <li>[Outcome 1]</li> <li>[Outcome 2]</li> <li>[Add more as needed]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#evaluate","title":"Evaluate","text":"<p>Making judgments based on criteria and standards through checking and critiquing.</p> <ul> <li>[Outcome 1]</li> <li>[Outcome 2]</li> <li>[Add more as needed]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"course-description/#create","title":"Create","text":"<p>Putting elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganizing elements into a new pattern or structure.</p> <ul> <li>[Outcome 1]</li> <li>[Outcome 2]</li> <li>[Capstone project ideas]</li> <li>[Add more as needed]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"feedback/","title":"Feedback on Graph Data Modeling","text":"<p>You are welcome to connect with me on anytime on LinkedIn or submit any issues to GitHub Issue Log.
